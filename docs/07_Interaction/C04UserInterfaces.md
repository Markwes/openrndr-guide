# User Interfaces

This topic discusses the creation of graphical user interfaces in OPENRNDR applications.


## The Panel library

The Panel library provides an HTML/CSS like user interface toolkit and is written using OPENRNDR.

To be able to use the Panel library add it to your `build.gradle` configuration.

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile('org.openrndr.panel:openrndr-panel:0.3.7')
}
```

## Basic Usage

The easiest way to use Panel is to use it as a Program extension. When used as an extension all mouse and keyboard events are automatically handled and drawing of the user interface will take place after your program's `draw()` has been invoked.

To create a very simple user interface that consists of just a single button one would do the following:

```kotlin
application {
    program {
        var color = ColorRGBa.WHITE
        val cm = controlManager {
            layout {
                button {
                    label = "click me"
                    // -- listen to the click event
                    clicked {
                        color = ColorRGBa(Math.random(), Math.random(), Math.random())
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        extend(cm) // <- this registers the control manager as a Program Extension
    }
}
```

## Style sheets

The Panel library borrows a lot of ideas from HTML/CSS based layouting systems, one of those ideas is style sheets.

Style sheets can be used as shown in the following example in which a style sheet is used to color a button blue.

```kotlin
application {
    program {
        controlManager {
            layout {
                styleSheet(has type "button") {
                    background = Color.RGBa(ColorRGBa.BLUE)
                }
                button {
                    label = "click me"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Selectors

The following example shows how to build and use complex selectors

```kotlin
styleSheet(has class_ "control-bar") {

    descendant(has type "button") {
        width = 100.percent
    }
    
    child(has type "slider") {
        width = 100.percent
        
        and(has state "hover") {
            background = Color.RGBa(ColorRGBa.RED)
        }
    }
}
```

## Elements

The Panel library comes with a built-in set of elements with which user interfaces can be composed.

### Element
`Element` is the base class from which all other elements derive. `Element` can be used directly but it is advised to use `Div` instead.


### Div

The `Div` represents a rectangular area in which other elements can be placed. The `Div` element is the main ingredient in the creation of layouts. Divs are best created using the `div {}` builder.

```kotlin
application {
    program {
        controlManager {
            layout {
                div("some-class-here", "another-class-here") {// -- children here
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```kotlin
div("some-class-here", "another-class-here") {// -- children here
}
```

### Button
An ordinary labelled button.
The default width of buttons is set to Auto such that the width is determined by the label contents.

```kotlin
button {
    label = "Click me"
    events.clicked.subscribe {// -- do something with the clicked event
    }
}
```

### Slider

A horizontal labelled slider control.

##### Properties
 * `label : String` - the slider label
 * `precision : Int` - the number of digits behind the point, set to 0 for an integer slider
 * `value : Double` - the slider value
 * `range: Range` - the slider range, default is `Range(0.0, 1.0)`

##### Events
* `valueChanged` - emitted when the slider value has changed

```kotlin
slider {
    label = "Slide me"
    value = 0.5
    range = Range(0.0, 1.0)
    precision = 3
    events.valueChanged.subscribe {
        println("the new value is ${it.newValue}")
    }
}
```

### ColorPickerButton
A button like control that slides out a HSV color picker when clicked

##### Properties
 * `label : String` - the label on the button
 * `value : ColorRGBa` - the currently picked color

##### Events
* `valueChanged` - emitted when a color is picked

```kotlin
colorpickerButton {
    label = "Pick a color"
    color = ColorRGBa.PINK
    events.valueChanged.subscribe {
        println("the new color is ${it.color}")
    }
}
```
