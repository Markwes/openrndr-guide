# Getting Started with OPENRNDR #

OPENRNDR provides an application framework that allows its users to write applications that run on Microsoft Windows, MacOS platforms and Linux/x64 systems.

## Requirements ##
 * A computer running any of our supported platforms.
 * A graphics adapter and drivers that supports OpenGL 3.3
 * JDK 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 installed. Latest (12) recommended. Both OpenJDK and OracleJDK work.
 * [IntelliJ Idea 2018.3](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) Community or Enterprise edition
 * A recent version of [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Setting up prerequisites
Before you start working with OPENRNDR please follow these instructions.
 * Install a Java Development KIT (JDK): [JDK installer for Windows](https://cdn.azul.com/zulu/bin/zulu12.1.3-ca-jdk12-win_x64.msi) [JDK installer for macOS](https://cdn.azul.com/zulu/bin/zulu12.1.3-ca-jdk12-macosx_x64.dmg)
 * Download [IntelliJ Idea Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download) and install it.

## Getting OPENRNDR

OPENRNDR is obtained by adding the OPENRNDR dependencies to your Gradle project. You don't have to download anything manually. We offer [ready-to-use artifacts](http://dl.bintray.com/openrndr/openrndr/org/openrndr/) through Bintray.

### Setting up OPENRNDR in IntelliJ Idea

Note: these instructions do not match with how IntelliJ 2018.3 handles the import from version control. IntelliJ will
detect the Gradle project automatically and will not prompt to pick an external model.

Use VCS -> Checkout from Version Control -> Git to open the "Clone Repository" dialog.

Fill in the url `https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr-gradle-template.git` and pick a target directory.

Checkout from version control? Yes.

In the Import Project dialog pick "Import project form external model" and select the "Gradle" model, click the "Next" button.

In the "Import Project" dialog the default settings should be OK. Make sure the "Use default gradle wrapper" option is selected and Gradle JVM has been picked. If no JVM options are available then create a new JVM option.

Click the "New Window" option.

All done. The Gradle project is now imported in IntelliJ Idea and you are ready to run the program.

### Run your first program

In IntelliJ, hover your mouse over the green triangle next to the `main()` function, right click and pick the `Run TemplateProgramKt` option in the pop-up menu. The sketch will now start.

On MacOS you will find that the program exits immediately with an error. To resolve this edit the run configuration (left of the play button in the main toolbar) and add
`-XstartOnFirstThread` to the VM arguments. The program should now work.
